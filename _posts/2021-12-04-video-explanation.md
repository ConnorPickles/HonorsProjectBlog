Just wanted to throw a quick post on here to say that I recorded a presentation of this project: [https://youtu.be/ysW2xjF5mdc](https://youtu.be/ysW2xjF5mdc)

There is also a [shorter version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjIPvkqwFAM) but if for some reason you've actually found this blog and care enough to read a post, you're probably more interested in the detailed explanation anyway.

I recorded these using Zoom, which I'd never done before. Biggest takeaway here is that Zoom completely butchers the framerate of any screen recording. Thankfully the only thing this impacts is showing off the slider for the lighting.
