This page serves as a list of TODOs for this project. It's mainly for my own benefit so I can keep track of the ideas that I either come up with or discuss, but it will also let anyone see the current state of the project and what I'm prioritizing. Higher priority tasks are at the top of the list.

## TODO
  - Overlay Esri ground cover to classify LiDAR points
    - Use this info to remove/replace LiDAR points for areas like water and fields
  - Investigate bathymetry data sources
  - Investigate Houdini for procedural asset generation
  - Find a way to detect sunlight levels at certain spots underwater
  - Find a way to incorporate DEM data (the LiDAR plugin doesn't support the file format for DEM that I currently have access to)
  - Figure out how to prevent light from going through LiDAR points (ex. from underneath mountains). This may be solved by classification.
