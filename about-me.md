My name is Connor Pickles, and I'm a 4th/5th year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria. I'm pursuing the Honors option for my degree, which requires spending a term working on a self directed project with supervision. This website serves as a record of the work that I did on this project. I've taken a large variety of CSC courses throughout my degree and while I don't have a particular specialty, I've greatly enjoyed courses such as Compiler Construction and Deep Learning for Computer Vision.

As the home page states, my motivation for working on this particular project is to get more familiar with some common game development tools (Unreal Engine and C++). Video games are my single biggest passion, and I spent most of my free time either playing games from many genres or watching videos that analyze the design of games. My dream job would be to work on video games both as a programmer and as a designer, combining my technical skill with my many (too many if you asked my mother) years of playing games.
