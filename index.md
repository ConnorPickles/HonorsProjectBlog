Welcome to my honors project blog! This blog serves as a means to document my work as I progress through the project. I will write a post after every session of work that describes what I got done, any issues I encountered, and any ideas that cropped up while working.

The project itself involves using Unreal Engine to determine viable sites for coastal kelp farms, by combing various geographical data (such as LiDAR). My motivation for working on this project is mainly to become more familiar with Unreal Engine and C++, since I am interested in going into game development after graduation.
